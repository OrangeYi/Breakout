1.The format of the command-line is 
	javac breakout speed (1-20) framerate (25-40)
	//1 is the fastest and 20 is slowest, but if you want, you can make it lager to let
	//the ball slowerer!

2.You can choose use mouse to play or keyboard to play.

3.Just like breakou game, it is not hard to play. Move you mouse or press the keyboard(right,lift,space) to control the 
  paddle and the ball launch.

4.And you have 3 chance to win the game, if you does not win the game (have 7000score or clean all the block) within 3
  lives, the game will restare and  the score will clean.(additional feature)

5.Each block is 100 points

6.(additional feature) You can click the checkbox level at the top of the frame to
   make the game harder.
   (for block of last row, you need to hit it 10 times to clean the block
    for block of last section row, you need to hit it 9 times to clean the block
    ……)
    and it is not a bug when the ball jump between the block, because there are gaps
    between the blocks and the ball and jump between it.
